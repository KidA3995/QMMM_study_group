# QM/MM study group


**Meetings are Fridays at 10 am.** Meetings will consist of sections spanning two weeks for each topic. The fist week will cover theory and presentframework code. In the week following you will attempt to code the method yourself. During the second meeting within a section, we will present a working version of the code, address any issues or questions, and discuss more advanced topics relating to the method.
